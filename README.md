# bounce-downloads

Sometimes you just want to see that `Downloads` folder bounce. Mac OSX only. This module executes the same behavior that you commonly see after downloading a file in Chrome--the `Downloads` folder in the dock bounces a few times.

```javascript
const bounceDownloads = require('bounce-downloads');
bounceDownloads();
```
